# Blue and Green Plus

https://pocketninja.github.io/enjine-blue-and-green-plus/

This is a rudimentary example of a tic-tac-toe like game. It demonstrates a very simple game made with Enjine, a toy ECS
JS game engine I'm chipping away at.

Builds on https://pocketninja.github.io/enjine-blue-and-green/, with the addition of being able to "stack"/take over
an existing tile if you have a piece larger than the piece currently on it.

It is using contemporary features of JavaScript, such as native classes and visibility. YMMV.

NB: The repo for Enjine itself is not publicly available right now - it's very unfinished and lacks many core features. 

NB: For best results, please use a desktop browser. Input tracking is designed to work with a mouse for the time being.
